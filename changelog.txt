Version 1.8.5
- Updated config file's allowedCommands section.
- Section is now formatted in a vertical list, as opposed to a horizontal, comma-separated list.
- Also added the rest of the SecureLogin commands that were not included originally, most notably the /changepassword command.
- All of this is updated automatically, so don't worry about a thing, my sweet child.

Version 1.8.4
- Fixed bugs in the process of switching from names to UUIDs in the players.yml file.
- Unless you know how to fix your old players.yml file by following the pattern of the rest of the file (it's only the first and/or second player
  in the file that's affected), simply delete your players.yml file before installing this version. But only do this if you had version 1.8.3
  installed before this version!
- Added in some v1.8.3 commands to the command help menu; just forgot to put them in when making the last version.

Version 1.8.3
- **Updated player file to UUID format.** Players are now found by their UUIDs in the file. Their usernames are still
  visible; a new "Name" key has been added to the player sections as well. Don't worry about changing the file, the
  plugin will automatically rearrange it for you.

- New command: /getsecurityanswer (/getsa) - View someone's Security Answer.
- New command: /changepasswordfor - Change someone else's password.

- New permission node: securelogin.getsecurityquestion - Grants access to /getsecurityquestion.
- New permission node: securelogin.getsecurityanswer - Grants access to /getsecurityanswer.
- New permission node: securelogin.changepassword.other - Grants access to /changepasswordfor.

- New permission node: securelogin.loginspawn.other - Grants access to /loginspawn <player>.
- Fixed a bug in the process of changing Security Answers. Not sure why no one reported this in the comments,
  since this bug made it impossible to change your own Security Answer.

Version 1.8.2
- Fixed the tpBack feature. Now when players log in they may be successfully teleported back to their
  original login location, as dictated by the config file.
- Cleaned up a few minor errors in the reloading process.
- Fixed a couple of typos in the config file.

Version 1.8.1
- Added Security Answer commands to the allowedCommands list in the config file. Not allowing these
  commands in the first place was a complete mistake.

Version 1.8.0
- Added Security Questions.
- Added Security Answers.
- Added changing passwords.
- Added configurable settings to block or unblock chat, item dropping, item pickup, breaking blocks,
  placing blocks, getting damaged, damaging other entities, and interacting with objects while a
  player is still frozen.
- Added a configurable list of commands that players are allowed to issue while they're still frozen.
- Made teleporting players to the LoginSpawn after logging in an option, instead of forcing it.
- Added the option to teleport players back to their previous login location after having entered their
  password at the LoginSpawn.
- **Updated the format of permission nodes to all lower case. Change your permission nodes in your permissions
  plugin to match this.**
- Added permission nodes for every command, as well as given a default allowance to each command's permission.
  For example, /SecureLogin used to have no permission node, making it accessible to everyone. Now it has a
  permission node that allows everyone to use it regardless of granting it in your permissions list. This feature
  also allows for negating permission nodes, if for some reason you don't want players to have their default commands.
- **Changed "SecureLogin.freezeOnLogin.exempt" permission node to "securelogin.nofreeze".**
- New command: /CreateSecurityQuestion (Alias: /CreateSQ) - Create your security question that you may use
  (according to the config file) to change your password, your old Security Question, or your old Security Answer
  (the answer to your Security Question).
- New permission node: securelogin.createsecurityquestion - Grants access to /CreateSecurityAnswer.
- New command: /ChangeSecurityQuestion (Alias: /ChangeSQ) - Change your Security Question.
- New permission node: securelogin.changesecurityquestion - Grants access to /ChangeSecurityQuestion.
- New command: /CreateSecurityAnswer (Alias: /CreateSA) - Create the answer to your Security Question.
- New permission node: securelogin.createsecurityanswer - Grants access to /CreateSecurityAnswer.
- New command: /ChangeSecurityAnswer (Alias: /ChangeSA) - Change the answer to your Security Question.
- New permission node: securelogin.changesecurityanswer - Grants access to /ChangeSecurityAnswer.
- New command: /ChangePassword - Change your password (go figure!).
- New permission node: securelogin.changepassword - Grants access to /ChangePassword
- New permission node: securelogin.login - Grants access to /Login
- New permission node: securelogin.register - Grants access to /Register
- **Fixed config comments, so now everything makes plenty of sense.**
- Split the config file into three files: players.yml, loginspawn.yml, and config.yml.

**The configuration file is now read differently! Take the following steps in order to not break your plugin!**
- Install SecureLogin v1.8.0 to your server, then restart or reload the server.
- Copy your "Players" section out of the main config, and paste it into your new "players.yml" file in the SecureLogin
  plugin folder.
- Copy your "LoginSpawn" section out of your main config, and paste it into your new "loginspawn.yml" file in the
  SecureLogin plugin folder.
- **Delete** your config.yml, which at this point is still your old config file, and then restart/reload your server again.
  This will update the config file to add its new settings and comments.
  
- Removed command: /SetMessage. Reason: It's quite difficult to put descriptive comments on messages in the config file without
  splitting the messages all into different files, which is still a bit difficult. No worries, you can still change them whenever
  you want to via directly using the config file. I'll try to put /SetMessage back into the plugin when I get the chance.
- Removed permission node: SecureLogin.setMessage. Reason: /SetMessage has been removed, making this node useless.
- Removed command: /SetMessageHelp. Reason: /SetMessage has been removed, making this command useless.
- Removed permission node: SecureLogin.setMessage.help. Reason: /SetMessageHelp has been removed, making this node useless.
